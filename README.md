# HomeBrew Tap
by Butanediol

## Installation

```shell-script
brew tap butanediol/homebrew
```

## Formulae

- `mkvtoolnix-gui`: Just MKVToolNix-GUI but build from source, mainly for Apple Sillicon users who wants native binaries.
- `contacts-phonetic`: Add pinyin for contacts, resolving the issue that sorting does not work properly on non-Chinese language iPhone/iPad.
